        <h4>Perfect choice for those who loves pork</h4>
        <p>
            This is a multiple prize-winning master recipe. 
            It has several steps that can be used on pork 
            spareribs, country-style ribs, or pretty much 
            any other type of pork rib; simply adjust oven 
            time up for meatier cuts. Use some soaked wood 
            chips on the barbecue. The smokier the grill, 
            the better the ribs will taste!

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <li>Clean the ribs, and trim away any excess fat. In a medium 
                        bowl, stir together the sugar, 1/4 cup salt, ground black 
                        pepper, paprika, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and garlic 
                        powder. Coat ribs liberally with spice mix. Place the ribs in 
                        two 10x15 inch roasting pans, piling two racks of ribs per 
                        pan. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Bake uncovered for 3 to 4 
                        hours, or until the ribs are tender and nearly fall apart. 
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Remove 5 tablespoons of drippings from the bottom of the roasting pans, 
                        and place in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in pan drippings until 
                        lightly browned and tender. Stir in ketchup, and heat for 3 to 4 more minutes, 
                        stirring constantly. Next, mix in water and brown sugar, and season to taste 
                        with cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and 
                        simmer for 1 hour, adding water as necessary to achieve desired thickness. 
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Preheat grill for medium-low heat. 
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        When ready to grill, add soaked wood chips to the coals or to the smoker box 
                        of a gas grill. Lightly oil grill grate. Place ribs on the grill two racks at a time so 
                        they are not crowded. Cook for 20 minutes, turning occasionally. Baste ribs 
                        with sauce during the last 10 minutes of grilling, so the sauce does not burn. 
                    </li>
                </p>
            </ol>
        </p>
